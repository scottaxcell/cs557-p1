Assumption in manager.conf:
A client with a file will also have a task to share that file.


Note: Since all communication is between ports on a single host it appears
that I don't have to worry about any network to host or host to network
translation of integers in packet payloads.

TODO:
DONE * (client) verify messages being sent are correct
DONE * (tracker) verify messages from clients are correct
* (tracker) verify static databases are being updated correctly
* (client) verify static databases are being updated correctly
* (tracker) verify messages being sent to clients are correct
* (client && tracker) add remaining messages once the above is good
* (tracker) figure out why it is dieing with non-zero exit status

* (tracker) add a termination timer and static variable
* (cient) add a termination timer and static variable

* client needs to tell tracker how large a file is so that the tracker
  can pass that information to clients so they know when they have completed a download




CLIENT:
/*
 * timer solution
 * create a timer for starttime to wake up client for file downloading
 * int (*fp)();
 * fp = fileTask(); fork to run this.. downloads or shares a file from clients in a loop
 * Timers_AddTimer(task->starttime,fp,(int*)1); figure out what we want to pass instead of the 1
 *
 * create a delay timer for a task
 *
 * while (true) {
 *  if timer goes off {
 *    run timer task: enable task (return -1 to die)
 *    run timer task: send segment to other client (return -1 to die)
 *    run timer task: can we terminate? (return 0 to reset)
 *  }
 *
 *  if files to download {
 *    send interest to tracker
 *    sendTrackerUpdate()
 *  }
 *
 *  s = select()
 *  if (s > 0) { // receive packet
 *    client seg req: create timer for segment response to wait t ms delay (delete timer on completion)
 *      sendClientSegmentReq() this function should start a request timout timer too
 *    client seg res: add segment to file I'm downloading
 *      handleClientSegRes() should reset global variable request timeout reads
 *    client info req: create timer to send segment info to client (t ms delay) (segments I have of file)
 *      sendClientInfoRes()
 *    client info res: update local segment info (client -> segment map)
 *      handleClientInfoRes() should reset requset timout variable
 *    tracker update: update group information we received from tracker
 *      handleTrackerUpdate() should reset requset timout variable
 *  } else if (s == 0) {
 *    timer expired
 *  }
