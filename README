How to build:
=============
$ make all


How to run:
===========
$ ./proj1


Reused code:
============
The only code I largely borrowed directly is from the test-app-c.c example
provided in the timers library. Specifically, the while loop logic for creating
and firing off timers. A change I made to this code was to remove the logic
that reminated the while loop if no timers existed. This behavior was not
desired in my code design.

Besides the timers library I referenced varies websites for snippets of
code for things I did not know how to accomplish in C. See the References 
section below for a list of the sites I referenced.


Message format:
===============
* I added the pktsize to hte beginnin of every message so that the receiver 
knows how much of the data to read. This way it is getting the full message.

GROUP_SHOW_INTEREST (client -> tracker): client notifies tracker of files it is interested in
  Fields: pktsize, msgtype, client id, number of files, filename, file size, type, ...
  * I added the file size so that downloading clients could know how large a file
  was that they were interested in downloading.


GROUP_ASSIGN (tracker -> client): tracker notifies client about other client meta data
  Fields: pktsize, msgtype, number files, filename, file size, num neighbors, neigh. id, neigh. ip, neigh port, ...
  * I added the file size so that downloading clients could know how large a file
  was that they were interested in downloading.


CLNT_INFO_REQ (client -> client): client queries client for segment information for a file
  Fields: pktsize, msgtype, client id, filename


CLNT_INFO_REP (client -> client): client notifies client of file segments it has to offer for a file
  Fields: pktsize, msgtype, client id, filename, num segments, segment number, ...


CLNT_SEG_REQ (client -> client): client queries client for a specific segment for a file
  Fields: pktsize, msgtype, client id, filename, segment number


CLNT_SEG_REP (client -> client): client sends a raw segment of a file to a client
  Fields: pktsize, msgtype, client id, filename, segment, size of segment, raw file data
  * I send the segment size because it may be less than 32 bytes since it
  may be the last (segment) portion of a file.


Idiosyncrasies:
===============
I did not implement the packet loss portion of the project for extra credit.


Protocol corner cases:
======================


Termination method:
===================


Surprises:
==========
In hindsight I should have stuck with a C/C++ implementation. I began with a
C/C++ implementation, but chose to rewrite the project in the early phase as
C only. I thought having only C datastructures would make the code easier to
manage. This turned out to be the wrong way to go. I miss judged how large and
complicated this project was. C++ would have a been a more solid solution as
it provides really nice containers and features. C++11 provides a really
nice API in the standard that allows the developer to not have to 
fuss with some of the nitty gritty details that need to be addressed in C.
For example, the vector datastructure would allow me to not have to have a 
separate variable for every container keeping track of how many elements are
actually used.
